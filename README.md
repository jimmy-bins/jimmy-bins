## Jimmy Bins' OpenSea Tracker v0.4 (Google Sheet)

Access here: [Jimmy Bins' OpenSea Tracker v0.4 (Google Sheet)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fF8B0pl00chUApp_OQgIq_Q2sZkZQYmW4xtvMEwZV_Q/edit?usp=sharing)

This Google Sheet is a good way to get a ballpark estimate of your current NFT portfolio. You add your wallet address and it fetches the current price of ETH, the public items in your wallet & current floor prices on OpenSea, then gives you a total value.
