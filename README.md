## Jimmy Bins' OpenSea Tracker v0.5 (Google Sheet)

*Update March 2022:* the OpenSea team changed their API to restrict querying their data without an API key. This has broken the current version of the sheet. I'm working to update the sheet to fix it, but I don't have an ETA yet.

Access here: [Jimmy Bins' OpenSea Tracker v0.5 (Google Sheet)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10bkLsuUkC-m2G_GyZlzC7PqQE2ZwX_rNRpatueS4iV0/edit?usp=sharing)

This Google Sheet is a good way to get a ballpark estimate of your current NFT portfolio. You add your wallet address and it fetches the current price of ETH, the public items in your wallet & current floor prices on OpenSea, then gives you a total value.
